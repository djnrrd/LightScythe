# LightScythe v3 #
## Credits ##
This project could not exist were it not for the work of [The Mechatronics Guy][mech],
[and his update][mech2].  The work I have done here is largely based on his list of
improvements.  Thanks dude.

## Hardware ##
As I didn't want to get involved with wiring buttons directly to the GPIO pins on my Pi
and it seemed that for images to be selected some form of display would be needed, I
opted for the [Adafruit 16x2 LCD plate with built in buttons][ada]. Assembly was simple
but does require a certain level of dexterity with a soldering iron as there are many pins
in a row that need to be soldered precisely.

Of course, for the strip I used 2 metres of the [Adafruit Digital LED Strip][ada2], which
I took delivery of today - so I guess the next step for this is making the scythe itself.
Oh, I do so love making things &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

But the star of the show is the [Raspberry Pi][rpi] - I have done and intend to do so many
things with this device. I run Raspbian, and for any of this to work you need to enable I2C
(for the display and buttons) and SPI (for the light strip).  To do this you will first
need to remove the modules from the blacklist (/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf):

    # blacklist spi and i2c by default (many users don't need them)

    #blacklist spi-bcm2708
    #blacklist i2c-bcm2708

And then you will need to enable the modules you need in /etc/modules:

    snd-bcm2835
    i2c-bcm2708
    i2c-dev
    spi-dev

Give the beast a reboot and she's good to go.

## Software ##
Well, this is it so far.  Despite my total lack of Python knowledge I seem to be doing OK.  
Got a class now which handles the byte mapping and resizing of images, I have a basic
Interface class as well, but the layout is totally up for change as my knowledge of Python
improves.
